          target="_blank"
        >
          Red&nbsp;Dead Redemption</a
        >. The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United
        States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and
        member of the Van der Linde gang, who must deal with the decline of the
        Wild West while attempting to survive against government forces, rival
        gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and
        third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam its
        interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies,
        hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and
        maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and
        deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and
        bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player.
      </p>
      <p>
        The&nbsp;game's development lasted over eight years, beginning soon
        after Red Dead Redemption's release, and it became one of the most
        expensive video games ever made. Rockstar co-opted all of its studios
        into one large team to facilitate development. They drew influence from
        real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an
        accurate reflection of the time with the game's characters and world.
        The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for eighth-generation
        consoles, having tested their technical capabilities while porting Grand
        Theft Auto V. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed
        by Woody Jackson and several vocal tracks produced by Daniel Lanois.
        Development included a crunch schedule of 100-hour weeks, leading to
        reports of mandatory and unpaid overtime. Red Dead Online, the game's
        online multiplayer mode, lets up to 32 players engage in a variety of
        cooperative and competitive game modes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Red&nbsp;Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox
        One in October 2018, and for Windows and Stadia in November 2019. It
        broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history
        of entertainment, generating US$725 million in sales from its opening
        weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of Red Dead Redemption in two
        weeks. The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its
        story, characters, open world, graphics, music, and level of detail, but
        some criticism at its control scheme and emphasis on realism over player
        freedom. It won more than 175 Game of the Year awards and received
        multiple other accolades from awards shows and gaming publications. It
        is considered one of eighth-generation console gaming's most significant
        titles and among the greatest video games ever made. It is among the
        best-selling video games with over 67 million copies shipped.

      <p>
        Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;2 is a Western-themed action-adventure game.
        Played from a first- or third-person perspective, the game is set in an
        open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the United
        States in 1899.[1][b] It features single-player and online multiplayer
        components, the latter released under Red Dead Online.[3] For most of
        the game, the player controls outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van
        der Linde gang, as he completes missions—linear scenarios with set
        objectives—to progress the story; from the epilogue, the player controls
        Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston. [4] Outside of missions,
        they can freely roam the interactive world.[5] They may engage in combat
        with enemies using melee attacks, firearms, bow and arrow, throwables,
        or dynamite, and can dual wield weapons. [6][7] The player can swim as
        Arthur but not as John.[8][c]
      </p>

      <p>
        Red&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;Redemption&nbsp;2's world features different
        landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife, and urban
        settlements ranging from farmhouses to towns and cities.[9][10] Horses
        are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds
        with different attributes. The player can steal horses and must train or
        tame wild horses to use them; to own a horse, they must saddle or stable
        it. Repeated use of a horse begins a bonding process, increased by
        leading, petting, cleaning, and feeding it, and the player will acquire
        advantages as they ride their horse. [11] Stagecoaches and trains can be
        used to travel; the player can hijack a train or stagecoach by
        threatening the driver and rob its contents or passengers.[12][13] The
        player may witness or partake in random events in the world, including
        ambushes, crimes, pleas for assistance, ride-by shootings, public
        executions, and animal attacks. They may be rewarded when helping
        others.[11][14] They may partake in side activities, including tasks
        with companions and strangers, dueling, bounty hunting, searching for
        collectibles such as rock carvings, and playing poker, blackjack,
        dominoes, and five finger filet.[15] Hunting animals provides food,
        income, and materials for crafting items. The choice of weapon and shot
        placement affect the quality and value of meat and pelt, and the player
        can skin the animal or carry the carcass, which will rot over time,
        decrease its value, and attract predators.[16][17]
      </p>
      <p>
        Some story moments give the player the option to accept or decline
        additional missions and lightly shape the plot around their choices.[18]
        They can choose different dialogue trees with non-player characters
        (NPCs), such as being friendly or insulting. If they choose to kill an
        NPC, they can loot their corpse.[19] The Honor system measures how the
        player's actions are perceived: morally-positive choices and deeds like
        helping strangers, following the law, and sparing opponents in a duel
        will increase Honor, while negative deeds such as theft and harming
        innocents will decrease it. Dialogue and outcomes often differ based on
        Honor level, and attaining milestones grants unique benefits: high Honor
        provides special outfits and store discounts, while low Honor grants
        more items from looting.[20]

        </a>
        <div class="text3">
          <em style="font-size: small;">The Red Dead Redemption 2's <strong>Dead Eye</strong> targeting system allows the player to
          slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence ends, the
          player fires to every marked location in a very short span of time.</em>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        In&nbsp;addition to health and stamina bars, the player has cores, which
        affect the rate at which their health and stamina regenerate. Freezing
        or overheating rapidly drains cores, preventable by wearing
        weather-appropriate clothing. The player can gain or lose weight
        depending on how much they eat; an underweight character will have less
        health but more stamina, while an overweight character can better absorb
        damage but with less stamina. Eating and sleeping replenishes cores. The
        player can bathe to remain clean and visit a barber to change
        hairstyles; hair grows realistically over time. Weapons require cleaning
        to maintain their performance. Using a certain type of gun extensively
        improves weapon handling, reduces recoil, and increases the rate of
        reloading.[21][22][23] The player can take cover, free aim, and target a
        person or animal. Individual body parts can be targeted to take down
        targets without killing them. Weapons consist of pistols, revolvers,
        repeaters, rifles, shotguns, bows, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling
        guns, and melee weapons such as knives and tomahawks. The player can use
        Dead Eye to slow down time and mark targets. Once the targeting sequence
        ends, they fire to every marked location in a very short space of time.
        The Dead Eye system upgrades progressively and grants abilities such as
        targeting fatal points.[24][25].
      </p>

      <p>
        When&nbsp;the player commits a crime, witnesses alert the law; the
        player can stop them to avoid repercussions. Law enforcers investigate
        once alerted. When the player is caught, a bounty is set on their head;
        as they commit more crimes, their bounty grows higher and more lawmen
        will be sent to hunt them. If the player escapes the law, bounty hunters
        track them down. After committing enough crime, the U.S. Marshals will
        be sent to the player's location. To escape law enforcement, they can
        evade the wanted vicinity, hide from pursuers, or kill them.[26] The
        bounty will remain on their head, lawmen and civilians will be more
        vigilant, and regions where crimes have been committed will be on
        lockdown. When caught by lawmen, the player can surrender if they are
        unarmed and on foot. They can remove their bounty by paying it off or
        spending time in jail.[27]

      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        After&nbsp;a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang are
        forced to leave their substantial money stash and flee Blackwater.
        Realizing the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws,
        they decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. They rob
        a train owned by Cornwall, who hires Pinkertons to apprehend them. The
        gang perform jobs to earn money, as Dutch continually promises the next
        heist will be their last. Following a shootout with Cornwall's men in
        Valentine, the gang relocate to Lemoyne, where they work simultaneously
        for the Grays and Braithwaites in an attempt to turn them against each
        other. However, the families double-cross them: the Grays kill Sean
        during an ambush in Rhodes, while the Braithwaites kidnap and sell Jack
        to Bronte. The gang retaliate and destroy both families before
        retrieving Jack from Bronte, who offers them leads on work but
        eventually double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an
        alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.
      </p>

      <p>
        The&nbsp;gang rob a bank in Saint Denis, but the Pinkertons intervene,
        killing Hosea and arresting John. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier, and Micah
        escape the city via a ship heading to Cuba. A torrential storm sinks the
        ship, and the men wash ashore on an island, Guarma, where they become
        embroiled in a war between tyrannical sugar plantation owner Fussar and
        the enslaved local population. After helping the revolutionaries kill
        Fussar, the group secure transport back to the United States and reunite
        with the rest of the gang, though they are soon assaulted by Pinkertons
        whom they repel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dutch,&nbsp;paranoid that a gang member is working as an informant,
        obsesses over one last heist. He doubts Arthur's loyalty after he
        disobeys him by liberating John earlier than planned, naming Micah his
        top lieutenant in Arthur's place. Arthur becomes concerned Dutch is no
        longer the man he knew, as he is becoming insular, abandons their
        ideals, and murders Cornwall. Faced with his mortality after being
        diagnosed with tuberculosis, Arthur reflects on his actions and how to
        protect the gang, telling John to run away with Abigail and Jack and
        openly defying Dutch by aiding the local Native American people. Several
        gang members become disenchanted and leave, while Dutch and Micah
        arrange one final heist of an Army payroll train.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arthur's&nbsp;faith in Dutch is shattered when he abandons Arthur to the
        Army, leaves John for dead, and refuses to rescue a kidnapped Abigail.
        Arthur and Sadie rescue Abigail from Milton, who names Micah as the
        Pinkertons' informer before Abigail kills him. Arthur returns to camp
        and openly accuses Micah of betrayal. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and Micah
        turn on Arthur and a newly returned John, but the standoff is broken
        when Pinkertons attack. The player can choose to have Arthur aid John's
        escape by delaying the Pinkertons or return to the camp to recover the
        gang's money. Micah ambushes Arthur, and Dutch intervenes in their
        fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player
        has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease while
        watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eight&nbsp;years later, in 1907, John and his family are trying to lead
        honest lives. They find work at a ranch where John reveals his combat
        experience against bandits threatening the ranch. Believing John is
        unwilling to give up his old ways, Abigail leaves with Jack. John takes
        a loan from the bank to purchase a ranch. He works with Uncle, Sadie,
        and Charles to build a new home, and proposes to Abigail on her return.
        Learning Micah is still alive and formed his own gang, John, Sadie, and
        Charles assault his camp. They find Dutch, who shoots Micah after a
        tense standoff and leaves in silence, allowing John to kill Micah and
        claim the gang's Blackwater stash to pay his debt. John marries Abigail
        and they start a new life on their ranch alongside Jack and Uncle, as
        Sadie and Charles leave for other pursuits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mid-credits&nbsp;scenes show the fates of other surviving gang members.
        Edgar Ross tracks down Micah's killer, which leads him to John's ranch,
        foreshadowing the events of Red Dead Redemption.[38]

        Preliminary work on Red Dead Redemption 2 began shortly following the
        release of the original game, Red Dead Redemption (2010).[39][40]
        Rockstar San Diego, the studio behind the original game, had a rough
        outline of the game by mid-2011, and by late 2012, rough scripts of the
        game had been completed.[41] When Rockstar Games realized a group of
        distinct studios would not necessarily work, it co-opted all of its
        studios into one large team,[40] presented simply as Rockstar
        Games,[40][42] to facilitate development between 1,600 people; a total
        of around 2,000 people worked on the game.[40] Analyst estimations place
        the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$370
        million and US$540 million, which would make it one of the most
        expensive video games to develop.[43]

        While the main theme of the original game was to protect family at all
        costs, Red Dead Redemption 2 tells the story of the breakdown of a
        family in the form of the Van der Linde gang. The team was interested in
        exploring the story of why the gang fell apart, as frequently mentioned
        in the first game.[40] Rockstar's Vice President of Creativity Dan
        Houser was inspired by film and literature when writing the game, though
        he avoided contemporary works to avoid being accused of stealing
        ideas.[41] The team was not specifically inspired by film or art but
        rather real locations.[44] The team was focused on creating an accurate
        reflection of the time, with people and locations. The citizens in the
        game feature a contrast between rich and poor, while the locales
        contrast between the civilization and the wilderness.[36]

        Red Dead Redemption 2's recording sessions began in 2013.[41] Rockstar
        wanted a diverse cast of characters within the Van der Linde gang. The
        writers put particular focus on the individual stories behind each
        character, exploring their life before the gang and their reasons for
        remaining with the group.[40] Several characters were cut from the game
        during development as their personalities failed to add to the
        narrative.[40] The actors sometimes improvised some additional lines,
        but mostly remained faithful to the script.[45] The team decided the
        player would control one character in Red Dead Redemption 2, as opposed
        to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title Grand Theft Auto
        V (2013), to follow the character more personally and understand how the
        events impact him.[40] They felt a single character is more appropriate
        for the narrative structure of a Western.[36]

        Red Dead Redemption 2 is the first game from Rockstar built specifically
        for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[46] Rockstar had tested these
        consoles' technical capabilities when porting Grand Theft Auto V,
        initially released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, to them. Once the
        team had defined what limitations were sustainable, they found the areas
        requiring the most focus.[47] One of Rockstar's goals with Red Dead
        Redemption 2's gameplay was to make the player feel as though they are
        living in a world, instead of playing missions and watching cutscenes. A
        method used to achieve this was through the gang's moving camp, where
        the player can interact with other characters. The team ensured the
        characters maintained the same personality and mood from cutscene to
        gameplay to make the world feel more alive and realistic.[40]

        Woody Jackson, who worked with Rockstar on the original game and Grand
        Theft Auto V, returned to compose Red Dead Redemption 2's original
        score.[41] Red Dead Redemption 2 has three different types of score:
        narrative, which is heard during the missions in the game's story;
        interactive, when the player is roaming the open world or in
        multiplayer; and environmental, which includes campfire singing songs or
        a character playing music in the world. The game's music regularly
        reacts according to the player's decisions in the world.[48] Jackson
        purchased several instruments from the Wrecking Crew featured on classic
        cowboy films.[48] In total, over 110 musicians worked on the music for
        the game.[49] Daniel Lanois produced the original vocal tracks for the
        game, collaborating with artists such as D'Angelo, Willie Nelson,
        Rhiannon Giddens, and Josh Homme.[48] Director of music and audio Ivan
        Pavlovich engaged saxophone player Colin Stetson, experimental band
        Senyawa, and musician Arca to work on the score.[49]

        Rockstar Games first teased Red Dead Redemption 2 on October 16–17,
        2016,[50][51] before the official announcement on October 18, 2016.[52]
        Originally due for release in the second half of 2017, the game was
        delayed twice: first to Q1/Q2 2018,[53] and later to October 26,
        2018.[54] According to Rockstar, the game required extra development
        time for "polish".[54] To spur pre-order sales, Rockstar collaborated
        with several retail outlets to provide special edition versions of the
        game.[55] A companion app, released alongside the game for Android and
        iOS devices, acts as a second screen wherein the player can view in-game
        items such as catalogs, journals, and a real-time mini-map.[56] The game
        was released for Windows on November 5, 2019,[e] and was a launch title
        for Stadia when the service launched on November 19, 2019.[58][59] The
        Windows version has visual and technical improvements.[57]
